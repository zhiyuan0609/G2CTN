# ðŸ“Œ G2CTN: Group Sampling and Global Location with Hierarchical Network for Point Cloud Analysis
![](https://github.com/zhiyuan0609/G2CTN/blob/main/figures/3.png)
G2CTN processes point clouds by first extracting group sampling features through a Group Sampling Strategy, then employs GSF modules for local geometry extraction and the GLF Block with PVA/GLA attention for multi-scale feature enhancement. This approach effectively expands the receptive field while capturing comprehensive geometric structure information.
